### Task 2: Brainstorm
Throughout this class you are going to do a large group project. Please write a paragraph that addresses:

#### 1. An idea of what you would want to work on 

So there are multiple ideas that I would like to do. Preferrably something that would enchance or help my everyday life or someone elses. So I listed the ideas down below, many have apps already created but I believe making them can be beneficial to learn and use the agile development process

- Study Buddy Finder
    -
    - Matches students with similar class schedules to form study groups.
    - Includes filters for study style, subject preference, and availability.

- Internship & Job Opportunity Tracker
    -
    - Scrapes internship/job listings from multiple platforms(linkedin, handshake, and more).
    - Matches students with opportunities based on their major, skills, and interests.
- Time Management & Goal Tracker
    -
    - Provides weekly summaries of time spent on studying, working, and personal activities.
- Job Application Tracker
    -
    - Helps job seekers track where they've applied and follow up on interviews
- Grocery Price Comparison
    -
    - Compares local grocery store prices for commonly bought items to save money.
- Pet Management App
    -
    - Feeding and Medication reminders.
    - Vet visits log with vaccination tracking.
    - Exercise and walk-tracking for dogs.
    - Pet Supply shopping list and restock alerts
    - Multi-pet profiles for different animals
- Personal Dashboard & Life Organizer
    -
    - Goal Tracking & Progress Insights.
    - This idea can go very deep

#### 2. Would using the agile development process be a good fit for the idea

I believe any project can benefit from the agile development process. Especially since these are software projects and the timeline is short. These ideas need to be prototyped as quickly as possible and the agile process can help. As we are developing the prototype agile scrum can help us pivot a different direction or can help us discover any requirement changes. 

#### 3. What are some potential challenges or roadblocks with your idea

One of the major challenges of the ideas is understanding the scope of the project. Such as assigning to many Features, Scalability, Performance, Competitive Market, Security, and Legal & Compliance issues.

### Task 3: Do you know agile?
Answer the following questions about agile:

#### 1. Give a specific example of a functional and non-functional requirement

- #### Functional Requirement
    User must have the ability to configure the application settings such as Volume, Window Resolution.
- #### Non-Functional Requirement
    X Microservice must have the capability to receive and process X message in under X amount of seconds.

#### 2. Describe the key differences between XP and Scrum
- #### Extreme Programming
    Focuses on engineering an technical practices. Test Driven Development and Pair Programming. Ensures High code quality and ensures any code entering the source code is tested.

- #### Scrum
    Uses iterations called sprints that are typically 2-4 weeks and whatever work is assigned on that sprint is fixed.

- #### Differences
    - XP Focuses more on the engineering practices. Scrum primarily a framework for work and processes.
    - XP Emphesizes continous integration and Test Driven Development. Scrum does not specify how to write code or implement any coding practices.

#### 3. Describe the primary differences between Scrum and Kanban
 - #### Kanban
    There are no sprints or fixed time periods. Kanbans focus is continous flow of work. As Stories are placed on the Kanban board from the backlog. Team members grab the highest critical stories due that week or what is available on the board.
 - #### Scrum
    Uses iterations called sprints that are typically 2-4 weeks and whatever work is assigned on that sprint is fixed.
 - #### Differences
    - Scrum has sprints and Kanban is a continous work flow
    - Scrum has fixed work on the sprints. Kanban does not have fixed time work, stories can be added or removed from the board at any time.
    - Scrum has roles such as Scrum Master, and Product Owner. Kanban can operate without any prescribed roles

#### 4. What is the difference between a sprint review and a retrospective
 - #### Sprint Review
    Sprint Reviews are mostly demonstrations to the stakeholders showcasing completed work. The main focus is showing incremental progress and capturing any feedback from the stakeholder. This one of the major benefits of agile, because teams can catch early mistakes or pivot a different direction if the current idea was bad.
 - #### Sprint Retrospective
    Sprint Resprospective is a meeting with the team to reflect about the sprint. Such as processes, performance, roadblocks, and how the team works together. This is also the time to congratulate team members that go above and beyond. Voice to leadership roadblocks and action items that the team needs.

#### 5. What are story points and what are they used for

In a Agile Development Process Story points are a unit of measurement used to estimate effort, and time required to complete a story.

In an ideal world, and ideal case. Story Points can help teams to measure how much work a team can handle in a given time. They are assigned based on factors such as the amount of work, and complexity or potential roadblocks.
